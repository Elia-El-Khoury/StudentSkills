# StudentSkills
it's a project where I use a JTable and implement a database.

we can add update or delete data from the JTable which will update them in the connected database tables

the information is stored in a database and then updated as needed.
the program will start with the previous data that was stored in the database from the last run.

you can edit the data from the form or directly from the JTable,(you need to click on the edited item after finishing your edit).


if we try to update data with unauthorized data like digits in name or an unavailable gender, subject or knowledge it will throw an error dialogue box and set the data back to the unedited phase
